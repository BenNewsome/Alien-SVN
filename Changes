1.4.5.1  Thu Sep 20 17:41:55 PDT 2007
    Now it really works!  Tried it on a clean Ubuntu machine with no
    SVN libraries installed.
    
    Portability considerations remain.

1.4.5.0  Wed Sep 12 03:10:01 PDT 2007
    First release.  Turns out it doesn't really work unless libsvn is
    already installed.
